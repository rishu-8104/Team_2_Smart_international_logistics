# Container Loading Optimization with AI-Powered Camera

This code provides a solution for optimizing container loading processes using an AI-powered camera. The solution involves capturing images of individual packages using an Oak-D Lite camera and analyzing them with computer vision techniques to determine their dimensions. The dimensions are then used to generate a 3D model of the optimal arrangement of the packages within the shipping container, taking into account factors such as weight distribution, proper stacking, and package fragility.
